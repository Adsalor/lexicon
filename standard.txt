Coding standards are as follows:

All JS files use PascalCase class names and camelCase function and variable names.
Bracketing style is K&R, so any brackets appear like:

functionExample() {
    //content
}

or like

if (condition) {
    //thing
} else if (condition2) {
    //thing 2
} else {
    //thing 3
}

Function arguments are spaced where practical and non-spaced if it allows them to remain on one line.

functionExample1(arg1, arg2) {
    //do things
}

as opposed to

functionExample2(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5) {
    //do more things
}

The same style is used for function call arguments. 

Indentation is 4-spaced. Code inside brackets is indented another indent from those brackets, i.e.

for (let col of arr) {
    for (let slot of col) {
        //do thing
    }
}

Documentation is placed above function definition. Comments within a function's code should be placed above
the line they apply to, or within the line using /**/ if a specific part of it is of interest. An if-else statement
can have the first line of the else block describe the conditions under which it is reached. Functions do not need to
be documented if they are simply and descriptively named, but confusing or complex functions should be clearly explained.
